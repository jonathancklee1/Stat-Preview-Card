# Stat-Preview-Card
Beginner Stat Preview Card Challenge from FrontMentor

Hi all,
This is my very first attempt at creating something on my own from Frontend Mentor. I only have very basic knowledge on HTML and CSS as I started learning 3 weeks ago. I have tried to replicate the card style to the best of my ability which I am proud of, based on default browser size and mobile size, but there are some obvious responsive problems through manual browser adjusting.

  1. Resizing browser down, only my right image flexbox item shrinks, not the both of them at the same time.
  2. Resizing browser down, content (text) on the right disappears at the bottom after the box shrinks.
  
My questions would be how do I fix the above problems.
Hope you guys can provide me with some useful feedback :)
